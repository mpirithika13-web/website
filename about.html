                <h3>HI !MY NAME IS <img src="image/pic1.png" alt="" id="ima"></h3>
                <p>And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!</p><br>
                <p>I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a<br>casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth<br>grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches<br>millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has<br>been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR,<br>Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.</p><br><br>
                <p>I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My<br>favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to<br>the dog park.</p>

        <h2>I LOVE FOOD!</h2>
        <p>In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make<br>and eat in my real, actual, every day life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog.<br>My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable AND exciting, whether you’re<br>cooking for yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited<br>about these recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and start<br>cooking.</p>
         <br><br>
         <p>On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food that you’re making. It will make my day if<br>you tag @pinchofyum in your Instagram photos and stories! We love to shout out our favorites<br>on Fridays with our Reader Awards on Instagram Stories.</p>

            <h1>FOOD BLOGGER PRO</h1>
            <p>As we grew the blog into a source of income, my tech-loving husband Bjork decided to detail<br>our journey publicly as somewhat of an “experiment.” And as a result, lots of people starting<br>asking us how they could do the same thing. In 2013, Bjork and I built a community called Food<br>Blogger Pro as a place to teach people everything we’ve learned over the last 7-8 years in this<br>industry.</p>
            <p>Okay, so can I brag about this since it’s really Bjork’s thing, not mine?</p>
            <p>You guys, Food Blogger Pro is amazing. It contains over 350 easy-to-understand videos, an<br>active community forum, a panel of industry experts, live monthly events where you can<br>submit your blogging questions, and discounts on tools and services made specifically for food<br>bloggers.</p>
